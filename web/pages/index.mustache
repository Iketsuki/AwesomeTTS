<p>AwesomeTTS brings text-to-speech playback and recording to users of the
  desktop version of <a href="http://ankisrs.net" rel="external">Anki</a>.</p>

<p>Several text-to-speech services can be used through AwesomeTTS, including
  ones that run as desktop software locally on your computer and others that
  make audio available over the Internet. AwesomeTTS supports both on-demand
  playback and storing/synchronizing audio files with your media collection,
  making it flexible enough for different needs.</p>

<p>Both Anki and AwesomeTTS are free and open-source software. You can study
  the source code, make changes, and contribute back to the community.</p>

<hr>

<p>Please note that as of December 2015, <strong>Google no longer allows
  software like AwesomeTTS to use its text-to-speech service</strong>. If you
  previously used AwesomeTTS with Google, please switch to
  <a href="/services">another service</a> that offers your language.</p>

<p>
  If your language is not well-supported by the other AwesomeTTS services but
  you know of another text-to-speech service that does have good support,
  please suggest it either on the

  <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons" rel="external">
    add-on support forum
  </a>

  or the

  <a href="https://github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS/issues" rel="external">
    GitHub repository issue tracker
  </a>

  so that the add-on can be improved.

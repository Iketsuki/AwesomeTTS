<p><a href="http://translate.google.com" rel="external">Google Translate</a>
  is an online text-to-speech service offering high-quality playback in many
  languages.</p>

<p>However, as of December 2015, <strong>Google no longer allows software like
  AwesomeTTS to use its text-to-speech service</strong>. If you previously
  used AwesomeTTS with Google, please switch to
  <a href="/services" rel=parent>another service</a> that offers your
  language.</p>

<p>
  If your language is not well-supported by the other AwesomeTTS services but
  you know of another text-to-speech service that does have good support,
  please suggest it either on the

  <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons" rel="external">
    add-on support forum
  </a>

  or the

  <a href="https://github.com/AwesomeTTS/AwesomeTTS/issues" rel="external">
    GitHub repository issue tracker
  </a>

  so that the add-on can be improved.
